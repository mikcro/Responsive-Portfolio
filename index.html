      <h1>About Me</h1>

      <img class= "PennybackerSunrise" src="assets/images/PennybackerSunrise.jpg">
      <p>For 25 years I have been emersed in the fire protection and security fields. I can walk up to a building and tell about the systems that make it function. Some people see buildings as a beautiful skyscraper covered in a skin of glass. I see a complicated,
            functioning, integrated organism. My carreer came to an abrupt end February of 2016 when I fell 27 feet and nearly died, breaking by back in 4 places, crushing my spinal cord and many other bones. I woke up totally paralyzed from the chest down but I was ready for the next challenge...learning to walk again.
        </p>
        <p>Grit! Since that day I have fought for recovery. I was tenacious in rehab and God blessed. What the doctors said I couldnt do, with Gods help I have. I am gaining back my independence. My vision with its many challenges and physical limitations,
            has now focused on coding as a new career choice. Like those who viewed that skyscraper, I viewed the internet...from the outside as a user only. Now with a keen desire to understand the inner workings of this complicated, functioning, integrated
            organism we call the world wide web, I have decided to take the next step and plunge into the world of coding. I see a path and I am going to follow it.
